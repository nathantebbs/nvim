# nvim
- This is my personal neovim configuration, which follows [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFHlfbKVi30&list=WL&index=1&t=577s&ab_channel=devaslife) guide as a starting point.



## This configuration is based off of:

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
